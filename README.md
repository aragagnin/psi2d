# Î¨2d
 
Psi2d is a web-based and extendible multi-player and mobile-friendly 2D shooting game. The server is written in node.js and the client uses vanilla JS (and shares most of the code base with the client).

**A prototype is currently hosted at https://psi2d.itch.io/psi2d**

## Getting Started


During each match (lasting 10 minutes) players run on the map and can collect life points (hearts) and ammoes (yellow circles). Player can shoot mental energy (here the name psi2d) in the form of white shells that  damage other players.
on mobiles: swipe on the lower side of canvas to move and jump; tap on the upper side of the canvas to shoot.
on desktops: WAD/arrows/space to move; click to fire.
The game is made with node.js. With node I am able to use the same exact "game" class files (as well for all js classes of dynamic elements inside the level game) and evolve the game world both in the web browser client and in the server.

The game is modular and one can easily add elements, level and player skills! I can make it open source if anyone is interested in co-operating with me
